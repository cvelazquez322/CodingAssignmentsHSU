Three important take aways:

1.) attackers can put ' to get a error unique to SQL
2.) attackers can use anything' or blah = 'bleh
3.) attackers can attempt to guess by simply filling in guesses

Why:

1.) Once the attackers know SQL is being used, they know to employ SQL injections as user input is not being properly handled
2.) due to the use of quotes attackers are able to inject their own SQL code by ending the first quote and leaving open their second one.
3.)	these guesses will eventually learn the names of table names, and their variables.
