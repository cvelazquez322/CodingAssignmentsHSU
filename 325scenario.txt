Daves Dogs has been taking care of Humboldt area pets since 2010.
 They have deluxe accommodations for dogs, and make sure their boarders get good exercise and plenty of attention.
 They run doggy day care so that owners can drop off their dogs while they are at work, or vacation and they also have classes to help train both owners and their pets. 
 Their employees are likewise well-cared for as well as well-trained.
 We do not allow volunteers to be near your dogs as we want the dogs to establish familiarity with workers and we want to be able to do back ground checks as our employees are all well trained.
 However we do have volunteers who help around the shop. 
 We do also allow a few of our workers to doggy sit, though this is a premium service as requires that the customer pay a monthly rate to be part of this higher tier service even if they do not
 request dog sitting that month.
