Three important take aways:

1.) Each of the different types of data fields need slightly different security rules.
2.) HTML entinty encoding is good for untrusted data in the body. Doesnt work if inside a <script> tag.
3.) never accept javascript from an untrusted source.

Why:

1.) Important because if you handled all fields with the same security measures, it wouldn't work.
2.) running html code inside of a script tag would work for a hacker, HTML entity encode doesnt apply to <script>
3.) javascript parameter "callback"
